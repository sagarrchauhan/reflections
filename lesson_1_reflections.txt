How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

    It helped in seeing the bugs comparitively

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

	I can easily see what changes i made, my programming approach and the pattern of my mistakes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

	Pros: User discretion helps the user himself to understand the history of code. Better management of versions and defining each version with type of update made.

	Cons: Doesn't follow a pattern in which commit happens. Can be cumbersome or very light according to the user.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	I think this helps the user understand what changes are made to other files concurrently.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
	
	git log: used to view the different versions of the file
	git diff: to view the differences between the two files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

	We can scroll through different versions and run the program at each version to see the introduction of an error without changing the programme.
