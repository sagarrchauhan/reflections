What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	The timeline is set at the point the repository is created. Now any changes can be tracked by different file versions.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area allows only those files to be tracked whose contents we want to track when it gets changed.
