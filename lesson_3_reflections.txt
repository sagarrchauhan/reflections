When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    
    When someone else wants to work on project or some other device is used to make a file.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	There can be some unknown changes which may lead to conflicts in either repository.
