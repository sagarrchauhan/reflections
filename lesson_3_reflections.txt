When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    
    When someone else wants to work on project or some other device is used to make a file.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	There can be some unknown changes which may lead to conflicts in either repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks - performed only on Github to copy one repository on Github itself.
	Clones - performed to copy a local repository or a remote repository to a local repository.
	branches - to add a new feature, experiment or do something new in the repository without creating a copy of repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	If any changes are made to the remote repository, it is easier to manage it locally by syncing it locally rather than pushing to an out of sync repository.
